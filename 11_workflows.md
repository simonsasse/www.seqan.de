As such SeqAn support easy integration of all its applications into workflow and data analysis engines, such as KNIME.
If you use the SeqAn command line parser, your application can write a desription of itself
(command line parameters, usage help, etc.) into an well defined XML format,
and we use this to automatically convert an SeqAn application into a KNIME workflow node.

Pretty convenient, isn’t it?
