I am working on algorithms to find and classify structural variations of DNA. Funded by the BMBF, I am is doing my PhD
at Freie Universität Berlin.
I hold two Bachelor of Science degrees in Mathematics and Informatics and a Master of Science degree in Bioinformatics
from Freie Universität Berlin.

I am developing a new application for the detection of structural variations.
Furthermore, I contribute to the C++ SeqAn library and I participate in the design and implementation of SeqAn's
[application template](https://github.com/seqan/app-template).

Generally, I am curious about mathematics and its connection to nature.
