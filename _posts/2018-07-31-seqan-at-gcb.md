We are happy to announce our tutorial, **SeqAn3 – a modern C++ library for efficient sequence analysis**, in a full day
tutorial at the GCB 2018 in Vienna.<!--more-->

This is a beginner tutorial and focuses on tool programming using modern C++ and the SeqAn3 library.
SeqAn 3 is a major redesign of our sequence analysis library based on modern C++ features such as Concepts and Ranges.
You will learn all about these new cool features and how tool programming is simplified using SeqAn3.

You can find more information regarding the tutorial at the [GCB 2018](https://gcb2018.csb.univie.ac.at/seqan3).

Please [register for the tutorials](https://gcb2018.csb.univie.ac.at/registration) directly at the GCB 2018.

Please don’t hesitate writing us if you have more questions.

We are looking forward meeting you there.

Your SeqAn Team

p.s. If you can’t make it to the GCB 2018, we will present the brand new SeqAn 3 design at our own User Meeting
from September 19th – 21st in Berlin, together with a lot of show cases, programming and KNIME tutorials, and many
great news for our users, regarding performance and efficiency. More information to our User Meeting will follow soon.

Also notify your colleagues about the opportunity to meet us at the [EECB 2018](http://eccb18.org/tutorial-9/).
